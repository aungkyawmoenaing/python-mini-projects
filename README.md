# Python Mini Projects

A collection of Python projects focused on core concepts, clean code, and real-world problem solving.

This repository acts as a long-term workspace for building, experimenting, and refining Python solutions across a wide range of small projects.

---

## About This Repository

* Contains many independent Python projects
* Each project lives in its own directory
* Project structure varies depending on scope and purpose
* Some projects are simple scripts, others are more structured

The focus is on clarity, practical implementation, and progressive improvement rather than enforcing a single rigid format.

---

## Organization

Projects are organized as individual folders.
Each folder represents a standalone idea, experiment, or solution.

Some projects may include:

* A single Python file
* Multiple modules
* Additional configuration or documentation

Details specific to a project are documented within its directory when necessary.

---

## Running Projects

Most projects can be executed using Python 3:

```bash
python <entry_file>.py
```

Refer to the project folder for any project-specific instructions.

---

## Intent

* Strengthen understanding of Python fundamentals
* Apply clean coding practices where appropriate
* Explore real-world programming problems
* Build a growing reference of Python implementations

---

## Maintenance Notes

This repository is continuously evolving.
Older projects may be refactored, expanded, or revisited as skills and understanding improve.
